# Gift Wrap Receipt Printer
![Example](assets/example.gif)
This app allows the gift wrap station to print receipts and tags.

## Notice

This app is not hosted on the internet because the connection to the printer is over http, and the web browser will not allow a mixed content connection.

## Getting Started
* Download the code as a zip file
* Open the index file to launch the app

## Network Setup
* The computer with this app needs to be on the same local network as the printer
* Recommended setup is to use a small network switch and connect laptops and printers to that - assign static IP addresses to all devices
